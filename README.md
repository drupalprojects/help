<h3>Help project overview</h3>

Connect people who need help with people who can give help.

On May 20, 2013, a tornado devastated Moore, Oklahoma. The next day volunteers at Drupalcon Portland reached out to FEMA to find out how we could help. Within 24 hours 100 volunteers contributed to the Drupal for Oklahoma, #Drupal4OK, effort and launched Help4OK.org. The site connects people who need housing with people who can offer housing and people who need a ride with people who can offer rides. In the week after the tornado, people in the affected area have requested similar new features:

<ul> 
  <li>Project cleanup assistance: Connect people who need help with cleanup with volunteers who are able to help.</li>
  <li>Equipment availability:  Connect those people who need cleanup equipment (bobcat, backhoe, etc.) with people who have special equipment that could be borrowed or rented.</li>
</ul>

Right now there are two parallel works in progress on this project:

#1 Help - Using help4ok.org as a proof-of-concept, incorporating feedback we've received from users and disaster response experts, we're working to make a Drupal distributionthat makes it fast and easy to set up and extend sites like help4ok.org.

#2 www.help4ok.org - This website is still actively in use supporting survivors and volunteers in the aftermath of the tornado in Moore, OK.

Notes about contributing:
Please grab an issue in the drupal.org issue queue, or review ROADMAP.md and create an issue for yourself to work on. We're trying to keep issue tracking centralized in the drupal.org issue queue. Most people contribute to drupal.org projects by attaching proposed patches to an issue in the issue queue. If you're more comfortable submitting pull requests on GitHub or forking the project into your own drupal.org sandbox, that's fine. But please submit your contribution by opening an issue in the issue queue and linking to your GitHub pull request or sandbox project. Pull requests on GitHub can be submitted here: https://github.com/bryanhirsch/help.
